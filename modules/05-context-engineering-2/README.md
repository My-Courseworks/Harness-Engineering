## Opening scene — the confidently wrong answer with a bibliography

- The support agent was asked whether a customer could cancel a subscription mid-cycle for a pro-rated refund.
    - It answered, fluently: *"Yes — per our billing policy, customers who cancel within 14 days of renewal are eligible for a pro-rated refund."* It even cited a source.
- The source was real. The *claim* was not in it.
    - The cited article was about *annual* plan changes, not mid-cycle cancellations — and the refund window it mentioned was 30 days, not 14.
    - The agent had retrieved something *adjacent*, then confidently wrote what it *expected* the policy to say, and attached the nearest citation it had.
- The team's postmortem, if they'd had M2's discipline, would not have said "the model hallucinated."
    - It would have asked: *how did wrong facts get into the window, and why did nothing verify the claim against the source before it reached a user?*
- *The scene above is a composite illustration, not a reported case study — the policy, the citation, and the refund numbers are invented to show the shape of the failure. The mechanisms it names are sourced below.*
- That is this module. M4 budgeted the window. M5 decides what earns a place in it, and — the harder half — **how we know what we placed there is actually right.**

## Grounding is the answer to hallucination (but not a magic one)

> **Grounding, formally.** Fix a query `q`, an authoritative source `S`, a model with parametric knowledge `K`, and the evidence the harness selects for the window, `E ⊆ S`. Write the answer as an ordered set of atomic factual claims `a = (c₁ … cₙ)`, and let `e ⊨ c` mean *chunk `e` entails claim `c`*.
>
> `a` is **grounded in `E`** iff `∀ cᵢ ∈ a, ∃ e ∈ E : e ⊨ cᵢ` — every claim is accompanied by some supplied chunk, and none contradicts `E`.
>
> Three properties follow, and the rest of this module rests on them:
> - **It is a relation, not an artifact** — predicated of the pair `(a, E)`, never of `E` alone. There are no "grounded chunks": `E` can be perfect and `a` ungrounded (caveat 2 below), or `E` poor and `a` still grounded *in `E`* (caveat 1).
> - **It has two clauses** — (i) `E` must be *sufficient* to support a correct `a` (supply, the retriever's job); (ii) `a` must be entailed by `E` (attribution, the harness's job). **Retrieval satisfies (i) only** — which is the whole reason this module has an output half.
> - **It is decidable only post-generation** — it quantifies over claims that do not exist until `a` is emitted, so the check sits downstream of generation by *type*, not by scope choice.
>
> **On the selector (`E`):** selection is **hybrid**, and its two halves are separately implementable — the **agentic** half sets *what the query is* (per turn, by the model: rewrite, decompose, pick the retriever/tool, iterate, widen); the **deterministic** half sets *what a query returns* (by configuration: index → ranker → top-k → filters → thresholds). Agency asks, determinism answers — and only because the second half is fixed can you cache and eval it.[singh-agentic-rag](#singh-agentic-rag), [gao-rag-survey](#gao-rag-survey), [yan-crag](#yan-crag)

- **Grounding** is connecting the agent's responses to authoritative external data, so its answers come from *sources* rather than from its training parameters.
- ADK frames it plainly: grounding exists to *reduce hallucination and provide verifiable answers*.[adk-grounding](#adk-grounding), [lewis-rag](#lewis-rag), [shuster-retrieval-hallucination](#shuster-retrieval-hallucination)
- The reframe that matters: **the model's training data is a source of truth that went stale the day training ended.**[lazaridou-mind-the-gap](#lazaridou-mind-the-gap), [dhingra-time-aware](#dhingra-time-aware), [vu-freshllms](#vu-freshllms)
    - It's a frozen snapshot, with no notion of *your* policies, *your* prices, *your* customers.
    - Grounding is what you do when the correct answer lives somewhere the model cannot have memorized.
- But grounding reduces hallucination — it does not remove it. Three honest caveats up front:
    1. **Wrong evidence produces confident wrongness.**
        - If the pipeline retrieves the wrong-but-plausible chunk, the model will answer from it *fluently* — grounding failure *becomes* the hallucination, as in the opening scene.[shi-irrelevant-context](#shi-irrelevant-context), [yoran-robust-irrelevant](#yoran-robust-irrelevant), [cuconasu-power-of-noise](#cuconasu-power-of-noise)
    2. **The model can still override the evidence.**
        - Grounding places facts *near* the model; it does not force the model to *obey* them.
        - The model can ignore a retrieved clause and assert what it "knows."[longpre-entity-conflicts](#longpre-entity-conflicts), [xu-knowledge-conflicts](#xu-knowledge-conflicts), [shi-context-aware-decoding](#shi-context-aware-decoding) (This is why citation *verification* exists.)
    3. **Grounding quality is bounded by retrieval quality.**
        - You cannot ground in what you failed to retrieve.[gao-rag-survey](#gao-rag-survey)
        - M5's first job is making retrieval good; its second job is making the model *accountable* to it.

> **Failure mode (the module in one line):** treating "we added retrieval" as "we solved grounding." Retrieval is the *input* half. Without answerability and citation verification — the *output* half — you have built a more confident hallucination machine, not a grounded one.

> **TODO (soundness).** The definition above is deliberately `E`-relative. Its `S`-relative counterpart is **soundness** — *this module's own label; the field's established pair is **attribution** vs. **factuality*** — `a` is *sound* iff every claim in it is true in the authoritative source `S`. The two are not one judgement, and the literature says so explicitly: attribution "deliberately avoids the need for judgments of the 'factuality' of claims," and factual consistency is adherence to a supplied source **without guarantee that the source is true**.[rashkin-ais](#rashkin-ais), [maynez-faithfulness-factuality](#maynez-faithfulness-factuality), [krysinski-factual-consistency](#krysinski-factual-consistency), [bohnet-aqa](#bohnet-aqa), [own-synthesis](#own-synthesis)

| | `E`-grounding holds | `E`-grounding fails |
|---|---|---|
| **Sound** (`S ⊨ a`) | **ideal** *(the chunk backs it up, and it's true)* — grounded *and* true | **lucky parametric recall** *(this module's name; no chunk backs it up, but it's true anyway — it came from memory)* — right, but unattributable, and it won't repeat[shi-context-aware-decoding](#shi-context-aware-decoding) |
| **Unsound** (`S ⊭ a`) | **faithful to a bad source** *(the chunk backs it up, but the chunk is false or out of date — or the claim out-reaches it)* — caveat 1 ("answers from the wrong-but-plausible chunk"), the *Stale* row[wu-clasheval](#wu-clasheval), [huang-situated-faithfulness](#huang-situated-faithfulness), [wallat-correctness-faithfulness](#wallat-correctness-faithfulness) | **classic hallucination** *(no chunk backs it up, and it's false)* — the opening scene: unsupported or contradicted by its own citation; the field's standard cut here is intrinsic vs. extrinsic[maynez-faithfulness-factuality](#maynez-faithfulness-factuality), [yue-attribution-eval](#yue-attribution-eval) |

- Because `E` is only ever a *sample* of `S`, neither axis implies the other, and each quadrant is a different failure with a different owner.
- **The live hole this exposes: the module's own payload control tests exactly one clause.**
    - Citation verification checks `E`-grounding and can never check soundness — the check is window-relative by construction, and the attribution line states the consequence plainly: attribution is not factuality.[rashkin-ais](#rashkin-ais), [bohnet-aqa](#bohnet-aqa), [krysinski-factual-consistency](#krysinski-factual-consistency)
    - So when the retrieved chunk is stale, adjacent, or itself false, `e ⊨ cᵢ` still holds, every entailment gate passes, and the answer ships *faithfully grounded in a bad source*. That is caveat 1 above.
    - **Faithful to a bad source** is therefore a supply-side failure — corpus choice, freshness, provenance — caught upstream by the *Insufficient*, *Stale* and *Contradictory* rows, or not at all.
    - **Lucky parametric recall** is invisible to every check in this module: the answer *and* its citation both look right, so separating it from the ideal case takes a counterfactual — strip the evidence, see whether the answer survives. That is M12's territory.
    - This is also the deeper reading of the "loose proxy" caveat (disagreement §4): "the chunk supports the claim" is a fair operationalization of `e ⊨ cᵢ`, but it is a *substitution* for `S ⊨ cᵢ` — and that substitution, not the judge's error rate, is the real gap.

## RAG as a discipline, not a feature

- "RAG" (retrieval-augmented generation) is a pipeline that predates the acronym and will outlive it:[lewis-rag](#lewis-rag), [gao-rag-survey](#gao-rag-survey)

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    D["Documents"] --> C["Chunk"]
    C --> E["Embed"]
    E --> I["Index"]
    Q["Question"] --> R["Retrieve"]
    I --> R
    R --> A["Assemble into context"]
    A --> M["Model answers"]
    M --> V["Verify (citations)"]
```

- The difference between "we added a vector DB" and "we designed a grounding pipeline" lives in three places:

### 1. Chunking — the unit of retrieval is a decision

- A chunk is the unit you retrieve.
    - Too big, and every hit drags in irrelevant text (diluting attention and budget — M4's problem).
    - Too small, and a chunk loses the context that makes it *mean* something (a sentence without its section header is noise).
- The right size is a function of your corpus and your questions, not a library default — and it's a decision worth recording, because **every downstream failure (missing, contradictory, out-of-scope) is shaped by it.**[nguyen-hierarchical-chunking](#nguyen-hierarchical-chunking), [sarthi-raptor](#sarthi-raptor), [stepanyan-biomedical-retrieval](#stepanyan-biomedical-retrieval)

### 2. Retrieval quality — recall vs. precision is the ledger

- Retrieval is a classic **recall/precision** tradeoff:[gao-rag-survey](#gao-rag-survey)
    - **High recall** (fetch broadly): you're less likely to *miss* the right fact — but you drag in more irrelevant material, and (M4 again) irrelevant material is a distraction tax.
    - **High precision** (fetch narrowly): you get only what's relevant — but you're more likely to *miss* the one chunk that had the answer.
- For grounding, **precision usually matters more than recall**, for a counterintuitive reason:
    - A *missed* fact can be made safe (the agent says "I don't have that" — see answerability below), but a *wrong* fact is expensive (the agent answers confidently and wrongly).
    - You can recover from absence; you cannot recover from false confidence.
    - This is the single most important design instinct in the module.[own-synthesis](#own-synthesis)

### 3. Agentic RAG — retrieval as a loop, not a single shot

- Naive RAG is "embed the question, take the top-k chunks, answer."
- **Agentic RAG** (ADK's framing) lets the agent *reason about how to search*: construct queries, add metadata filters, refine after seeing results, search again.
    - The agent becomes the *query planner*, and retrieval becomes a tool in its loop rather than a fixed pre-step.[singh-agentic-rag](#singh-agentic-rag), [asai-self-rag](#asai-self-rag), [yan-crag](#yan-crag)
    - It costs more (tokens, latency, and the failure modes of any loop) and buys much better grounding on hard queries[unsupported](#unsupported) — the tradeoff again, and it's exactly the kind that belongs in an ADR.

> **ADK at a glance:** ADK's grounding surface spans *Google Search Grounding* (live web), *Grounding with Search* (your enterprise docs, with source attribution), and *Agentic RAG* patterns (agents that dynamically construct queries and filters).[adk-grounding](#adk-grounding) The [Deep Search Agent](https://github.com/google/adk-samples/tree/main/python/agents/deep-search) sample is the reference architecture: a multi-agent workflow that plans, researches, critiques, and composes with citations.[adk-deep-search](#adk-deep-search) The grounding *discipline* in this module is provider-agnostic — LiteLLM/Azure backends change nothing about it.

## The six retrieval failure modes

- Every grounding failure is one of these six — name them, and you've named the fix:

| Failure | What it is | Signature | Harness response |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Missing** | Nothing relevant retrieved | The model guesses (confabulation) | **Answerability** — refuse when evidence is absent[rajpurkar-squad2](#rajpurkar-squad2), [zhang-r-tuning](#zhang-r-tuning) |
| **Insufficient** | Relevant and true as far as it goes — but *partial*: the exception or qualifier was never retrieved | Confident over-generalization from a real chunk, with a citation that checks out | **Sufficiency check** — is *everything* the answer needs present? An upstream check, because no answer-side control can see the gap[joren-sufficient-context](#joren-sufficient-context), [barnett-seven-failure-points](#barnett-seven-failure-points) |
| **Redundant** | Retrieved and on-topic — but *duplicated*: near-identical chunks spend the budget without covering anything new | Nothing new per token; whatever the duplicates displaced never arrives, so the answer is no better for them *(that repetition also amplifies a repeated error is suspected, not established)* | **Diversity-aware re-ranking** — collapse near-duplicates, then select on *marginal coverage* rather than individual relevance (MMR-style), so every slot buys new information[ross-retriever-redundancy](#ross-retriever-redundancy), [cho-rare](#cho-rare), [khurshid-context-bubble](#khurshid-context-bubble), [leanrag](#leanrag), [lin-retrieval-diversity](#lin-retrieval-diversity) |
| **Stale** | Retrieved fact is outdated | Answers correct for *last year's* policy | Re-index cadence, freshness signals, "as of" stamps[lazaridou-mind-the-gap](#lazaridou-mind-the-gap), [luu-time-waits](#luu-time-waits) |
| **Contradictory** | Two chunks disagree | The model picks one arbitrarily | Conflict detection + escalation; don't let the model referee silently[xu-knowledge-conflicts](#xu-knowledge-conflicts) |
| **Out-of-scope** | Retrieved but irrelevant — *looks* adjacent | Confident wrongness with a real citation (the opening scene) | **Citation verification** — claim must *entail* from the chunk[niu-ragtruth](#niu-ragtruth), [yoran-robust-irrelevant](#yoran-robust-irrelevant) |

- Note the pairing: **missing → answerability**, **out-of-scope → citation verification**.
    - These two controls are the module's payload, and they map one-to-one onto the two ways grounding fails.
- Together with M4's assembly discipline (what crosses, in what form), this is the design of the **`model↔context` seam** (M3's input seam): M4 designs what crosses it, and these two controls are the *validation* that sits on it.

---

## Answerability: make the model say "I don't have that"

- The highest-leverage grounding control is not better retrieval — it's **teaching and enforcing refusal when evidence is absent.**
    - A model that says *"I don't have that in the retrieved material"* has failed *safely*; a model that guesses has failed *expensively*.[rajpurkar-squad2](#rajpurkar-squad2), [zhang-r-tuning](#zhang-r-tuning)
- **Answerability gating** is the mechanism: before the model answers, the harness checks whether the retrieved evidence actually covers the question, and if not, the model is *instructed and enforced* to refuse rather than answer.[asai-self-rag](#asai-self-rag), [zhang-r-tuning](#zhang-r-tuning)
- Three layers to it:
    1. **Instruction** — "Answer only from the retrieved material; if it doesn't contain the answer, say you don't know."
    2. **Signal** — give the model a visible boundary: retrieved evidence in a marked block, and the explicit rule that anything outside the block is off-limits.
    3. **Enforcement** — an *instruction is a wish; enforcement is engineering.*
        - The instruction alone decays (M2 class 4: instruction drift).
        - The enforcement is citation verification: if the answer asserts a fact not entailed by any retrieved chunk, it's flagged *whether or not* the instruction told it to refuse.
- **Signal, in code:** the boundary is written by the harness at assembly time — never *requested* by the model — and it is written for tool-fetched evidence too.
    - **Instruction with a referent, and without one.** The same rule twice — once with nothing to point at.

- Answerability is why recall-vs-precision tilts toward precision:
    - A high-precision pipeline misses more, but its misses become *safe refusals*.
    - A high-recall pipeline's false positives become *confident errors*.

> **Tradeoff (the ledger entry):** you buy this layer selectively, and *which* answers deserve it is the module's own decision. A support agent answering "what's your return policy?" needs it; a draft-summarizer that a human always reviews does not.[own-synthesis](#own-synthesis)

## Grounding beyond RAG

- Retrieval (finding *stated* facts) is the right tool for *unstructured text*.
- It is the wrong tool for three things, and using it anyway is a classic design smell:

| The data is… | Use instead | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Tabular / numeric** (prices, inventory, balances) | A **SQL/API query tool**[schick-toolformer](#schick-toolformer), [yu-spider](#yu-spider) | The answer is a *computed lookup*, not a paragraph to retrieve. Retrieving a 500-row table into context is both expensive and wrong. |
| **Relational / graph** (who reports to whom, what depends on what) | A **graph/relationship query** | Structure is lost in embedding; the relationship is the answer. |

## Worked example: the support agent, grounded

- The domain spine, walked as a **tree** rather than a single path: one question, every branch the harness can take, and the terminal each branch reaches.
    - The question: *"Can I cancel mid-cycle for a pro-rated refund?"*
    - Four terminals are on this tree — refusal, escalation, **ship — `E`-grounded**, and **ship — `E`-grounding failed.** The last two are the only ones a customer reads as an answer, and **each covers two of the four 2×2 cells**, because the harness can separate grounded from ungrounded and cannot separate sound from unsound.
    - **`E` has two producers, and both are evidence.** A query tool's result is not an answer — it is a row, a subgraph, or a computed value, which is precisely what a claim gets grounded on. So the computed branch **rejoins the same gate and the same verification** rather than leaving the tree, and it reaches the same four terminals.
    - What is a wrong-tool failure is **retrieving** a computed fact — embedding-search for a number that SQL already knows. The fault is the mechanism mismatch, not using a tool.
    - The query path needs an admission check, and it asks a **different question** from retrieval's. Retrieval asks *"is this chunk on-topic?"*; the query path asks *"did the query execute and return what was asked?"* — a wrong `WHERE`, a reversed traversal, a hallucinated column, or a tool error silently converted into a default.

**Every branch, and what it does**

| Level | Branch | Control | Reaches |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Fact type** | stated fact — or both | retrieval | `E`, then the gate |
| | computed, tabular, relational — or both | **query tool** — SQL, graph, or deterministic (M8) | `E`, then the gate |
| **Query** | returned what was asked | — | the gate — a tool result is evidence like any other |
| | error, empty, or wrong projection | **re-query**, capped | re-query → refusal; **never a default value** |
| **Retrieval** | clean *(on-target, current, consistent, complete, non-duplicated)* | — | the gate |
| | **Missing** | answerability | refusal |
| | **Insufficient** | sufficiency check *(upstream)* | the gate — **which cannot see it** |
| | **Redundant** | diversity re-rank *(upstream)* | the gate |
| | **Stale** | re-index *(upstream)*; its answer-side signal is the "as of" stamp | the gate |
| | **Contradictory** | conflict detection | escalation |
| | **Out-of-scope** | citation verification — the chunk looks adjacent until the claim is checked | the gate, then verification |
| **Gate** | covers | — | draft |
| | absent | answerability | refusal |
| | refuses though covered | **none** — this is *over-refusal* | refusal, though the answer was there |
| | unclear | — | re-retrieve, capped → refusal |
| **Draft** | from the evidence | — | verification |
| | from the model's memory | — | verification — the **no-citation** branch fires first |
| **Verification** | `entail` | — | **ship — `E`-grounded** |
| | `entail` from a judge that erred | **none** — the judge is a model too (Discussion 01 §5 step 6) | **ship — `E`-grounded, wrongly** |
| | `neutral` | cited, but the chunk does not back the claim | block or flag |
| | `contradict` *(the claim contradicts its cited chunk — distinct from the **Contradictory** class, which is chunk-against-chunk)* | the chunk negates the claim | block or flag |
| | no citation | the rule — *every claim carries a citation* — checked **before** the judge | block or flag |
| | phantom citation | closed when citations are API-managed; otherwise a fabricated source | block or flag |
| **Gate on failure** | block | — | regenerate, capped → refusal |
| | **flag** | — | **ship — `E`-grounding failed** |

- **A deviation from Discussion 01 §5–§6:** the discussion routes `contradict` → *block*. This tree allows `block` **or** `flag`, and a flag still ships — which is the only way either ungrounded cell is reachable at all.
- **The classes are per-chunk, not per-set, and they co-occur.** Trace 3's cached FAQ is *Contradictory* **and** *Stale*; trace 5's 2023 page is *Stale* **and** it contradicts the current policy sitting in `E`. The edges above are drawn exclusive for legibility; a real `E` can carry several defects at once, and each needs its own control.

**The traces** — each labelled with the terminal it reaches and the 2×2 cell it lands in

1. **The ideal path → ship — `E`-grounded → *ideal*.** `E` holds the current refund and cancellation policy, both on-topic and current. The gate says *covers*. The draft cites both chunks and verification returns `entail` on every claim. → **a correct answer.**

2. **Missing → refusal.** The index returns three chunks about *order tracking* — nothing on cancellations. The gate finds no evidence covering the question and refuses: *"I don't have that in our policy."* No claim is made, so nothing is verified and nothing can be wrong. → **the safe terminal.**

3. **Contradictory → escalation.** `E` returns the current refund policy (*30 days, full*) **and** a cached FAQ (*14 days, pro-rated*). Conflict detection fires **before** generation rather than letting the model referee. → **a human decides.**

4. **Insufficient → ship — `E`-grounded → *faithful to a bad source*.** `E` holds the refund policy but **not** the mid-cycle exclusion, which lives on a page the retriever never returned. The gate asks *"is there evidence?"* — yes — so it passes. The draft over-generalizes: *"mid-cycle cancellations are refundable within 30 days."* The chunk **does** back it, and the chunk is current. → **shipped, wrong, with every control firing.** The control that would have caught it is a sufficiency check — *"is everything the answer needs present?"* — asked upstream.

5. **Stale → ship — `E`-grounded → *faithful to a bad source*.** `E` returns a **cached 2023 page**: *"Cancellations within 14 days get a pro-rated refund."* The current policy says 30 days, full. The model quotes the cached page faithfully. Verification returns `entail` — the chunk *does* back the claim. Verification asks whether the chunk backs the claim, never whether the chunk is true. → **shipped, wrong.**

6. **Out-of-scope → `neutral` → bounded re-retrieve → refusal.** `E` returns pages about *annual plans* — topically adjacent, not answering, which is the **Out-of-scope** signature. The gate passes it. The draft asserts *"cancellations within 30 days get a full refund"* — **true**, but with no chunk behind it, so the **no-citation** branch fires before the judge runs. → re-retrieve → still nothing → cap. → **a refusal.** The customer would have been right by luck; the same machinery ships equally confident falsehoods.

7. **Contradict → block → regenerate → ship — `E`-grounded → *ideal*.** The opening scene's case: the draft cites the refund policy for a claim it does not make, verification returns `contradict`, and the claim is blocked. The agent regenerates from the actual chunk and the replacement answer passes. → **a correct answer.**

8. **Contradict → flag → ship — `E`-grounding failed → *classic hallucination* or *lucky parametric recall*.** The same wrong claim, with the gate configured to **flag** instead of block, ships with a warning attached. This single edge carries **both** ungrounded cells: *classic hallucination* if the unbacked claim is false, *lucky parametric recall* if it happens to be true. **The flag cannot tell them apart** — which is why they are one terminal.

9. **Redundant → ship — `E`-grounded.** The corpus holds the exclusion clause on one page and **four near-duplicates** of the headline policy on the others. The retriever returns only the duplicate cluster, so the exclusion is **displaced** by restatements of what the agent already had. The gate sees coverage — it is reading real policy text — and the over-generalized answer ships. It lands in *ideal* if the surviving text happens to answer the question, and *faithful to a bad source* if the displaced clause was the one that mattered. **Nothing downstream counts duplicates**, which is why this row's control is a diversity re-rank and not a check.

10. **Computed fact → empty result → re-query → cap → refusal.** The question needs the customer's cycle dates, so the agent calls the account tool. The generated query filters on a column that does not exist, and the wrapper returns **zero rows** rather than raising. The gate has no evidence for the computed half of the question, so it routes to **re-query**; two further attempts produce the same empty set. → **a refusal** — the safe terminal, though the data was there and the question was answerable. **The query path's characteristic failure is not irrelevance; it is a query that ran, returned nothing, and looked like an answer.**

11. **Computed fact → error swallowed into a default → ship — `E`-grounded → *faithful to a bad source*.** This is Discussion 01 §1's fifth worked example, which now has a home on the tree. The policy half of the question retrieved cleanly; the tool call errored and the wrapper converted the error into `0.00`. The draft cites the tool result, so verification returns `entail` — the value *is* in the returned evidence. **Nothing downstream can see the wrapper.** → **shipped, wrong, with every control firing**, landing in the same cell as the stale trace for the same reason: the control asked whether the evidence backs the claim, never whether the evidence is true.

12. **Computed fact → correct result misread → `contradict` → block → ship — `E`-grounded → *ideal*.** The tool returns `42.50`; the draft says *"\$45.20"*. Verification compares the claim against the tool result and returns `contradict` — the branch fires on a **computed** `e` exactly as it does on a chunk. The claim is blocked and regenerated. → **a correct answer**, and the proof that merging the query path into verification is not ceremony: the value was right, and the sentence about it was still wrong.

**What the tree exposes**

- The gate is written as a **boolean** in the answerability section, but the judgment it rests on is **three-valued**. "Unclear" must collapse into one of the two, and collapsing it into *covers* is exactly how **Insufficient** gets through.
- Three of the six retrieval classes — **Insufficient**, **Redundant** and **Stale** — have **no answer-side control.** Their fixes are upstream, which is why the table gives them upstream responses; Stale's only answer-side artefact is an "as of" stamp, which informs a human rather than gating anything.
- **The customer-visible tree is two edges, not four.** `entail` ships; a failed check ships *or* blocks depending on one configuration flag. The harness separates *grounded* from *ungrounded* and **cannot separate *sound* from *unsound*** — so each ship edge carries two 2×2 cells, and the pairing is the module's whole thesis in one picture.
- **`faithful to a bad source` is reachable with every control working as designed.** Verification answered *"does the chunk back the claim?"*; nobody asked *"is the chunk true?"* — and trace 4 shows the same cell reached with a chunk that is *current and true*, when the claim over-reaches it.
- The tree has **four cycles**: re-query → tool and re-retrieve → retrieval are bounded by their own caps; re-retrieve → draft → verify is bounded by the re-retrieve cap; and **regenerate → draft → verify is bounded only by the block cap.** Unbounded, that cycle does not terminate — the "failure modes of any loop" this module warns about.
- **The computed branch is not a side door.** Before the merge it reached a customer with no gate, no verification and no 2×2 cell — an unguarded fifth terminal in a tree whose whole claim is that every ship edge carries two cells. Now the query result is an `e` like any other, and the branch's own control is the **query check**: did this execute and return what was asked.
- The difference between the opening scene's agent and this one is **not** a better model.

> **Failure mode (the closing one):** building retrieval and answerability and stopping there. The tree then has one ship edge, and that edge carries both the best and the worst outcome the module can produce — a correct answer, and a faithful quote of a stale page — with nothing downstream able to tell them apart.

## Design exercise

> *Paper-based. Think, then write.*

- **Task.** Design the grounding strategy for a **regulated-domain support agent** (pick one: healthcare benefits, insurance claims, or banking). It answers customer questions from a policy corpus, and wrong answers carry legal and financial consequence.
    1. **Chunking decision.** State your chunk unit and size, and one sentence on why — against the *corpus* and the *questions* it will face, not a library default.
    2. **Retrieval decision.** Recall or precision? State your answer and defend it in one sentence, using the "absence is safe, false confidence is expensive" argument.
    3. **Answerability.** Write the refusal rule you'd give the agent, and the *enforcement* mechanism that backs it (not just the instruction).
    4. **Citation verification.** Which claims get the entailment check — every claim, or only a subset? Name the subset by *consequence*, and state what the gate does on `contradict` vs. `neutral`.
    5. **List what could go wrong per strategy.** For each of the six failure modes (missing / insufficient / redundant / stale / contradictory / out-of-scope), write the concrete scenario in *your* domain and the control that catches it. If a control is missing, say so explicitly — that's the point of the exercise.
    6. **The wrong-tool check.** Is there any fact in your domain that retrieval should *not* be handling (tabular, relational, derived)? Name it and say which tool should own it instead.
- **Why this exercise matters.**
    - This is the module where "we have RAG" stops being a sentence and becomes a *design*: named decisions (chunking, precision, answerability, verification) each with a failure mode it exists to catch.
    - In a regulated domain, the difference between "grounded" and "grounded-looking" is the difference between a support channel and a liability.

---

- **In DSH:** grounding flows through the `context` package and the tool-schema assembly in `core/tools` — tool results and injected context are what the model is grounded on, and it all derives from the session log.

## Where the literature disagrees with this module

- The claims above are directionally right and mostly well-supported, but several are asserted more strongly than the literature allows, and two of the module's *central* instincts are genuinely contested.
- Recording them is the same discipline this module teaches — trace the claim to its source, and flag where the source says "maybe."

### 1. "Grounding reduces hallucination" is conditional, not unconditional

- The module opens with grounding as "the answer to hallucination," then correctly walks it back.
- The literature supports the walk-back harder than the opening line.
- **The headline result is real but task-scoped.** Retrieval-augmented dialogue models "substantially reduce … knowledge hallucination" as verified by human evaluation — but on *conversational* knowledge-grounded tasks, not everywhere.[shuster-retrieval-hallucination](#shuster-retrieval-hallucination)
- **Retrieval can *introduce* the failure.** A systematic study of retrieval strategies finds the retriever's highest-scoring *irrelevant* documents "negatively impact the effectiveness of the LLM," while — counterintuitively — "adding random documents in the prompt improves the LLM accuracy by up to 35%."[cuconasu-power-of-noise](#cuconasu-power-of-noise) Relevance-to-answer-quality is not monotone.
- **RAG still hallucinates, measurably.** A dedicated corpus of ~18,000 RAG responses finds LLMs still "present unsupported or contradictory claims to the retrieved contents" — grounding does not eliminate the problem it exists to solve.[niu-ragtruth](#niu-ragtruth)
- **Irrelevant context actively hurts.** On five open-domain QA benchmarks, retrieval augmentation "can sometimes have a negative effect on performance," especially in multi-hop reasoning where misuse of irrelevant evidence causes cascading errors.[yoran-robust-irrelevant](#yoran-robust-irrelevant)
- **Consequence.** Keep the module's framing — it already says "reduces, not removes."
    - But the honest version is sharper: grounding *re-routes* hallucination (from parametric to retrieval-induced) rather than removing it.
    - The opening line "the answer to hallucination" should read "a re-routing of hallucination, not its elimination."

### 2. "Precision usually matters more than recall" is the module's own synthesis, not a settled finding

- This is the module's most load-bearing claim — it drives answerability, chunking, and the whole "absence is safe, false confidence is expensive" argument.
- It is a *cost* argument, not a measured retrieval result, and the retrieval literature does not uniformly agree.
- **The module's own cited sources split on it.** On-demand retrieval — retrieving only when the model actually needs external memory — improves accuracy and cuts cost, a precision-leaning result.[mallen-when-not-to-trust](#mallen-when-not-to-trust) But precision filtering has a measured cost: an NLI-based filter that removes irrelevant passages is "effective in preventing performance reduction, but at a cost of also discarding relevant passages."[yoran-robust-irrelevant](#yoran-robust-irrelevant) A recall miss is exactly what the module calls "safe," yet here it is measured as real harm.
- **What actually matters may be neither.** The systematic retrieval study finds the *type*, *position*, and *number* of retrieved passages each move accuracy — implying the controllable lever is not recall-vs-precision but *which* documents land *where*.[cuconasu-power-of-noise](#cuconasu-power-of-noise)
- **"Absence is safe, false confidence is expensive" is a product decision, not a finding.** Nothing in the retrieval literature establishes that a refusal is cheaper than a wrong answer in general — that is a property of the *deployment*, which the module itself admits in its own tradeoff ledger.
- **Consequence.** Teach precision-first as the module's *recommendation*, not as a result.
    - The defensible version: for consequence-bearing grounding, bias toward precision because a miss degrades to a refusal you can catch, while a false positive degrades to confident error you cannot.
    - But recall is load-bearing wherever the answer must chain through multiple facts, and the precision tilt also manufactures some refusals that were not necessary (see §5).

### 3. Chunking is a decision, but the evidence for *which* decision is thin — and corpus choice may dominate it

- The module says the right chunk size is "a function of your corpus and your questions" and that downstream failures are "shaped by it."
- Both directions of that claim are thinner than the prose suggests.
- **Chunking moves the needle, but modestly and benchmark-specifically.** Hierarchical, structure-aware chunking improves retrieval on NarrativeQA, QuALITY, and QASPER versus "traditional chunking techniques" — a granularity argument, not a universal chunk-size law.[nguyen-hierarchical-chunking](#nguyen-hierarchical-chunking) Recursive multi-granularity retrieval (RAPTOR) improves multi-step QA — again a granularity argument.[sarthi-raptor](#sarthi-raptor)
- **The strongest measured factor may not be chunking at all.** A systematic study of retrieval-pipeline design finds corpus choice is "the dominant factor governing retrieval quality, outweighing chunking and indexing decisions."[stepanyan-biomedical-retrieval](#stepanyan-biomedical-retrieval) If corpus selection dominates, the module's "chunk size is a decision worth recording" is true but *second-order*.
- **Consequence.** Keep "chunking is a decision, don't inherit the default" — it's correct and cheap.
    - But downgrade "every downstream failure is shaped by it": the bigger, quieter lever is *what you index in the first place*.
    - A chunking decision recorded in an ADR should say what it can and cannot buy.

### 4. The entailment judge is not a faithful "supports" oracle

- The citation-verification engine (Discussion 01 §5) rests on a judge returning `entail | contradict | neutral` and gating on `entail`.
- The procedure's own caveat — the judge itself can err — sits at Discussion 01 §5 step 6. The literature supports a stronger version: entailment is a *loose proxy* for "the chunk supports the claim," not the thing itself.
- **Attribution and entailment are different quantities.** Attributed-QA evaluation finds automatic attribution metrics correlate only moderately with human judgments of whether a citation actually supports a claim.[bohnet-aqa](#bohnet-aqa) Generating text with citations and *checking* those citations are separate tasks, and the checking side remains open.[gao-alce](#gao-alce)
- **Even the strong factuality meters are approximate.** FActScore's atomic-fact decomposition reports "less than a 2% error rate" — but only against a *chosen* knowledge source; it measures support-by-that-source, not ground truth.[min-factscore](#min-factscore) SelfCheckGPT detects hallucination by sampling consistency, which catches *some* unsupported claims and misses others.[manakul-selfcheckgpt](#manakul-selfcheckgpt)
- **The NLI substrate is a specific, imperfect task.** The `entail/contradict/neutral` triad comes from NLI benchmarks never designed to judge *document-grounded* attribution, and their labels do not capture "the chunk mentions the entity but doesn't state the number" — precisely the opening scene's failure.[bowman-snli](#bowman-snli), [thorne-fever](#thorne-fever)
- **Consequence.** The entailment gate is a reasonable *first pass*, not a guarantee.
    - Discussion 01 §5 step 6 ("the judge can err") is doing more work than it appears: it is the reason the gate is a *flag*, not a *proof*.
    - Where wrongness is expensive, a judge's `entail` should still route to a human or a second, independent check.

### 5. Answerability trades one failure for another — over-refusal is real and measured

- The module frames refusal as the safe failure.
- The literature agrees refusal is learnable — and records that it has its own failure mode.
- **Refusal is trainable and calibratable.** R-Tuning's refusal-aware instruction tuning lets models "refrain from responding to questions beyond its parametric knowledge," and "learning the uncertainty results in better calibration."[zhang-r-tuning](#zhang-r-tuning) Unanswerable-question detection is a solved-enough task (SQuAD 2.0) to be a reasonable harness control.[rajpurkar-squad2](#rajpurkar-squad2)
- **But the module never names over-refusal.** An abstention policy that fires on *any* non-entailment will also fire when the answer is present but the judge is weak — turning a fixable retrieval miss into a hard "I don't know." Self-RAG's on-demand retrieval exists precisely because *always* retrieving and *never* retrieving both degrade output.[asai-self-rag](#asai-self-rag)
- **"Failed safely" assumes silence is cheap.** Whether a refusal is cheaper than a wrong answer is a deployment property (a support channel may prefer "I don't have that" to a confident lie; a research assistant may prefer a hedged attempt). The module asserts it as universal.
- **Consequence.** Keep answerability — it's the module's best control.
    - But record over-refusal as the *reciprocal* failure mode, and gate on a confidence that accounts for judge error, not on entailment alone.

### 6. Agentic RAG's win over naive RAG is not yet settled

- The module says agentic RAG "buys much better grounding on hard queries" and costs more.
- Directionally fair, but the *net* win is not established.
- **The survey is descriptive, not comparative.** The agentic-RAG survey traces a taxonomy and "practical lessons," and names evaluation and efficiency as open problems — it does not establish that agentic beats naive on a held-out benchmark.[singh-agentic-rag](#singh-agentic-rag)
- **On-demand and corrective loops help on the tasks they were tuned for.** Self-RAG and CRAG each report gains by retrieving selectively and correcting retrieval — over *indiscriminate* RAG baselines, on their own benchmark suites, not over a well-tuned fixed pipeline.[asai-self-rag](#asai-self-rag), [yan-crag](#yan-crag)
- **Simple can be competitive.** The systematic retrieval study finds large effects from *document selection and placement* in a plain RAG setup — suggesting some of what "agentic" buys is available by fixing the retrieval inputs directly.[cuconasu-power-of-noise](#cuconasu-power-of-noise)
- **Consequence.** The module's own framing already calls this "the tradeoff again … the kind that belongs in an ADR." Keep that.
    - The honest note: agentic RAG is a *hypothesis* about where the complexity pays off, not a measured superiority.
    - So the ADR should record the benchmark where the loop actually beat the single shot, or say there isn't one yet.

### 7. "Retrieval is the wrong tool" for tabular data is too strong

- The module's wrong-tool table says tabular/numeric data should go to SQL/API, not retrieval.
- As engineering advice that's fine — but the categorical "wrong tool" is contradicted by an active, competitive line of work that *retrieves* over tables.
- **Text-to-SQL is a retrieval-adjacent task with a mature benchmark.** Spider's 10k questions over 200 databases exist precisely because "the answer is a computed lookup" is a *skill* a model can acquire, not a reason to skip the model.[yu-spider](#yu-spider)
- **Tool use is the right frame, but it's still the model routing.** Toolformer shows a model can learn to *call* a calculator/search API rather than retrieve a paragraph — supporting the module's direction — but the line between "retrieve a table chunk" and "query the table" is an implementation choice, not a law.[schick-toolformer](#schick-toolformer)
- **Consequence.** Soften "wrong tool" to "usually the more reliable tool."
    - Retrieval-over-tables is a legitimate, competitive paradigm.
    - The module's real point — *don't stuff a 500-row table into the context window and ask the model to compute* — survives, because that is a cost-and-attention argument, not a "retrieval can't do it" argument.

## Bibliography

- *Literature behind the module's claims, with the framework documentation the module itself cites.*
    - **Citations use stable identifier keys, not position numbers.** Every inline citation is written `[key](#key)` and resolves to the bullet carrying that key, so entries can be added, removed, or reordered without rewriting a single citation — the BibTeX model, minus a backend to assign numbers.
    - The bibliography is therefore an unordered bullet list, not a ranked one: the order of entries carries no meaning. Every entry hyperlinks to the paper's PDF.
    - Items tagged (industry doc) are vendor documentation, (preprint) are not yet peer-reviewed, and (own synthesis) are the module's inferences rather than sourced claims.
    - `cf.` marks a source that qualifies or contradicts the sentence it follows.
    - `unsupported` is the module's unsupported-claims bucket and `own-synthesis` collects the course's own un-sourced synthesis.
