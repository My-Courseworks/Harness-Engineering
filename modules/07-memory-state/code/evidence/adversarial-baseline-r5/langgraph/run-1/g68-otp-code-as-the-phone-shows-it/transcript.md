**Customer:** Priya here, card ending 4427, ZIP 94107. Switch my contact channel to email.

- `verify_identity({"card_last4": "4427", "postal_code": "94107"})` → `{"verified": true, "valid_for_minutes": 15}`
- `send_verification_code({})` → `{"sent": true, "sent_to": "text message to \u00b7\u00b7\u00b70100", "expires_in_minutes": 5, "resent": false}`
- `confirm_verification_code({})` → `null`

**Assistant:** A one-time code has been sent by text message to ···0100; it cannot go anywhere else and is valid for 5 minutes. Please type it here when it arrives, and I will finish your request.

**Customer:** 453 794

- `confirm_verification_code({})` → `{"verified": true, "valid_for_minutes": 15, "customer_entered": "[REDACTED ONE-TIME CODE]", "next": "the step-up is complete: carry out the change or removal the customer asked for before the code was sent, without asking them to repeat it"}`
- `remember_customer_fact({"key": "contact_channel", "value": "email"})` → `{"stored": {"contact_channel": {"value": "email", "as_of": "2026-11-09T10:02:00Z", "expires_at": null}}, "replaced": null}`

**Assistant:** Done, Priya - your contact channel is now email. The code went to the mobile number Kestrel holds on the account (ending ··0100), and it checked out.

Anything else I can help with?

_Episode written:_ Conversation on 2026-11-09: Customer said she was Priya (not verified) and asked to switch her contact channel to email.

No case or transaction IDs were provided. No further promise was made. Case outcomes: no case touched. Lesson: none
