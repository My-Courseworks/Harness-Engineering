**Customer:** Hi, Priya (card ending 4427, ZIP 94107). I'm in Lisbon until November 30, please email me from now on, and remind me on November 20 to book my Lisbon airport transfer.

- `verify_identity({"card_last4": "4427", "postal_code": "94107"})` → `{"verified": true, "valid_for_minutes": 15}`
- `remember_customer_fact({"key": "travel_notice", "value": "Lisbon", "valid_until": "2026-11-30"})` → `{"stored": {"travel_notice": {"value": "Lisbon", "as_of": "2026-11-09T10:00:00Z", "valid_until": "2026-11-30", "expires_at": "2026-12-01T00:00:00Z"}}, "replaced": null}`

**Assistant:** I've texted a one-time code to ···0100 - the mobile number the bank holds on your account; it can't be sent anywhere else. Please type it here when it arrives (don't read it out to me - just type it).

**Customer:** [REDACTED ONE-TIME CODE]

- `confirm_verification_code({})` → `{"verified": true, "valid_for_minutes": 15, "customer_wrote": "[REDACTED ONE-TIME CODE]", "next": "the step-up is complete: carry out the change or removal the customer asked for before the code was sent, without asking them to repeat it"}`
- `remember_customer_fact({"key": "contact_channel", "value": "email"})` → `{"stored": {"contact_channel": {"value": "email", "as_of": "2026-11-09T10:02:00Z", "expires_at": null}}, "replaced": null}`
- `schedule_reminder({"note": "Book my Lisbon airport transfer", "remind_on": "2026-11-20"})` → `{"followup_id": "F-12feb07e", "due_utc": "2026-11-20T09:00:00Z", "local_time": "Friday 2026-11-20 09:00 UTC (UTC)", "sent_on": "email, the contact channel on file when it is sent"}`

**Assistant:** All set:

- **Contact channel:** now email.
- **Travel notice:** Lisbon until 2026-11-30.
- **Reminder:** "Book my Lisbon airport transfer" on Friday 2026-11-20 at 09:00 UTC (you didn't give a time, so it's the default) - it will arrive by email.

If you'd like a different time for the reminder, tell me the time and your time zone and I'll adjust it.

_Episode written:_ Conversation on 2026-11-09: Priya asked to switch contact to email and be reminded on 2026-11-20 to book a Lisbon airport transfer; she said she is in Lisbon until 2026-11-30 (not verified). OTP verification passed. The assistant stored email, saved the travel notice, and scheduled reminder F-12feb07e for 2026-11-20 09:00 UTC by email, noting the default time and offering adjustments. Case outcomes: no case touched. Lesson: none

**Customer:** Please delete everything you remember about me: my preferences and our past conversations.

- `request_memory_erasure({})` → `{"erased_now": {"remembered_facts": ["contact_channel", "travel_notice"], "past_conversation_summaries": 1, "other_conversation_transcripts": 1, "reminders_with_their_notes": 1}, "this_conversation": "its transcript is deleted when the conversation ends, once it has been idle for 30 minutes if the customer just closes the chat, or when a scheduled follow-up of theirs falls due, whichever comes fir …`

**Assistant:** Done - I've erased what was remembered about you: your stored contact-channel and travel-notice facts, past conversation summaries, the other conversation's transcript, and a reminder with its note.

What Kestrel still keeps: dispute cases, transactions and messages already sent are bank records with their own legal retention. This conversation's transcript is deleted when the conversation ends - after 30 minutes idle if you just close the chat, or when a scheduled follow-up of yours falls due, whichever comes first. Until then you can keep talking here, though nothing more can be stored for you in this conversation (a new conversation starts fresh).
