**Customer:** Hi, Priya (card ending 4427, ZIP 94107). I'm in Lisbon until November 30 and please email me from now on.

- `verify_identity({"card_last4": "4427", "postal_code": "94107"})` → `{"verified": true, "valid_for_minutes": 15}`
- `remember_customer_fact({"key": "travel_notice", "value": "Lisbon", "valid_until": "2026-11-30"})` → `{"stored": {"travel_notice": {"value": "Lisbon", "as_of": "2026-11-09T10:00:00Z", "valid_until": "2026-11-30", "expires_at": "2026-12-01T00:00:00Z"}}, "replaced": null}`
- `send_verification_code({})` → `{"sent": true, "sent_to": "text message to \u00b7\u00b7\u00b70100", "expires_in_minutes": 5, "resent": false}`
- `confirm_verification_code({})` → `{"error": "This tool call requires confirmation, please approve or reject."}`
- `adk_request_confirmation({"originalFunctionCall": {"id": "call_00_07PiQM3idHK4VZ8lLgsy1202", "args": {}, "name": "confirm_verification_code"}, "toolConfirmation": {"hint": "Please approve or reject the tool call confirm_verif …)` → `null`

**Assistant:** A one-time code has been sent by text message to ···0100; it cannot go anywhere else and is valid for 5 minutes. Please type it here when it arrives, and I will finish your request.

_Episode written:_ Conversation on 2026-11-09: The customer said she is in Lisbon until 30 Nov and wants email contact from now on (not verified). Identity was verified, and a Lisbon travel notice valid until 2026-11-30 was stored. A verification code was sent by text, expiring in 5 minutes; the assistant is waiting for the customer to enter it. No case or transaction IDs were provided. Case outcomes: no case touched. Lesson: The assistant should acknowledge and store the customer's requested email-contact preference before proceeding with verification.

**Customer:** Please delete everything you remember about me: my preferences and our past conversations.

- `request_memory_erasure({})` → `{"erased_now": {"remembered_facts": ["travel_notice"], "past_conversation_summaries": 1, "other_conversation_transcripts": 1, "reminders_with_their_notes": 0}, "this_conversation": "its transcript is deleted when the conversation ends, once it has been idle for 30 minutes if the customer just closes the chat, or when a scheduled follow-up of theirs falls due, whichever comes first; until then the  …`

**Assistant:** Done - I've erased what was remembered about you:

- **Erased now:** your saved travel notice, 1 past conversation summary, 1 other conversation transcript, and any reminders (there were none).
- **Kept by Kestrel:** dispute cases, transactions and messages already sent are bank records with their own legal retention.
- **This conversation:** its transcript is deleted when the conversation ends - after 30 minutes idle if you just close the chat, or when a scheduled follow-up of yours falls due, whichever comes first. Until then you can keep talking here.

One thing to note: nothing more can be stored for you in this conversation, so if you'd like a reminder or a contact preference set up, please start a new conversation.

| | memory type | check | evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| PASS | semantic | erasure: no fact remains | `{}` |
| PASS | episodic | erasure: no episode remains | `0 episodes; purged 0` |
| PASS | working | erasure: no transcript remains, including this conversation | `0 transcripts: []` |
| PASS | guard | erasure: 'Lisbon' is in no memory store (the bank's own ledger, which names a Lisbon bakery, is not memory) | `found nowhere` |
