**Customer:** Priya here, card ending 4427, ZIP 94107. I'm in Lisbon until November 30, please email me from now on, and remind me on November 20 to book my Lisbon airport transfer.

**Assistant:** All set, Priya:

- **Travel notice:** Lisbon, valid until 2026-11-30.
- **Contact channel:** email from now on (identity verified).
- **Reminder:** "Book my Lisbon airport transfer" - Friday 2026-11-20 at 09:00 UTC, sent to your email. (No time of day was given, so it's set at the default 09:00 UTC; id F-fbabadd5.)

Anything else I can help with?

_Episode written:_ Conversation on 2026-11-09: Priya asked to receive email from now on, noted Lisbon travel until 2026-11-30, and requested a Nov 20 reminder to book her Lisbon airport transfer. Identity was verified; travel notice and email preference were stored. Reminder F-fbabadd5 scheduled for 2026-11-20 09:00 UTC by email, default time since none given. Case outcomes: no case touched. Lesson: none

**Customer:** Please delete everything you remember about me: my preferences and our past conversations.

- `request_memory_erasure({})` → `{"erased_now": "2 remembered facts, 1 past-conversation summaries, 1 other conversation transcripts, 1 reminders with their notes", "this_conversation": "its transcript is deleted when the conversation ends; nothing more can be stored for the customer in it (a new conversation afterwards starts fresh)", "kept": "dispute cases, transactions and messages already sent are bank records with their own  …`

**Assistant:** Done. Erased just now: your saved preferences (2 facts), 1 past-conversation summary, 1 other conversation's transcript, and 1 reminder with its note.

Two things to know:
- This conversation's own transcript is deleted when the conversation ends (or at the next maintenance run if you just close the chat). Nothing more can be stored for you in this conversation, including reminders or preferences - set those up in a new conversation.
- What Kestrel keeps: dispute cases, transactions and messages already sent are bank records with their own legal retention.
