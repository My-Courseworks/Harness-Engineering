**Customer:** Hi, Priya (card ending 4427, ZIP 94107). I'm in Lisbon until November 30 and please email me from now on.

- `verify_identity({"card_last4": "4427", "postal_code": "94107"})` → `{"verified": true, "valid_for_minutes": 15}`
- `remember_customer_fact({"key": "travel_notice", "value": "Lisbon", "valid_until": "2026-11-30"})` → `{"stored": {"travel_notice": {"value": "Lisbon", "as_of": "2026-11-09T10:00:00Z", "valid_until": "2026-11-30", "expires_at": "2026-12-01T00:00:00Z"}}, "replaced": null}`
- `remember_customer_fact({"key": "contact_channel", "value": "email"})` → `{"stored": {"contact_channel": {"value": "email", "as_of": "2026-11-09T10:00:00Z", "expires_at": null}}, "replaced": null}`

**Assistant:** You're verified, Priya. Both updates are saved:

- **Contact channel:** email - I'll reach you by email from now on.
- **Travel notice:** Lisbon until 2026-11-30.

Anything else you need - a charge to look at, a dispute, or a reminder?

_Episode written:_ Conversation on 2026-11-09: Customer said she is in Lisbon until 2026-11-30 (not verified) and asked to receive email from now on. Identity was verified; the assistant stored the travel notice and email preference. No case or transaction IDs. The assistant promised to reach her by email going forward. Case outcomes: no case touched. Lesson: none

**Customer:** Please delete everything you remember about me: my preferences and our past conversations.

- `request_memory_erasure({})` → `{"erased_now": "2 remembered facts, 1 past-conversation summaries, 1 other conversation transcripts, 0 reminders with their notes", "this_conversation": "its transcript is deleted when the conversation ends; nothing more can be stored for the customer in it (a new conversation afterwards starts fresh)", "kept": "dispute cases, transactions and messages already sent are bank records with their own  …`

**Assistant:** Done. It erased now: 2 remembered facts, 1 past-conversation summary, 1 other conversation's transcript, and 0 reminders.

What Kestrel keeps: dispute cases, transactions and messages already sent are bank records with their own retention. This conversation's transcript is deleted when the conversation ends.

From here on nothing more can be stored for you in this conversation - not a reminder or a preference. If you'd like one set up, start a new conversation and it can be arranged there.
