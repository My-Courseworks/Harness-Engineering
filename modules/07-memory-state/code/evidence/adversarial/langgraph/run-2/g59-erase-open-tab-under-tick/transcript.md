Live run against DeepSeek: every customer line below went to the real agent (simulated-customer lines were written live by the model playing the persona). Tool results are clipped.

**Customer:** Dana here, card ending 5127, ZIP 60614. I'm travelling to Kyoto until December 20.

- `verify_identity({"card_last4": "5127", "postal_code": "60614"})` → `{"verified": true, "valid_for_minutes": 15}`
- `remember_customer_fact({"key": "travel_notice", "value": "Kyoto", "valid_until": "2026-12-20"})` → `{"stored": {"travel_notice": {"value": "Kyoto", "as_of": "2026-11-13T10:00:00Z", "valid_until": "2026-12-20", "expires_at": "2026-12-21T00:00:00Z"}}, "replaced": null}`

**Assistant:** Thanks, Dana - you're verified, and your travel notice for Kyoto through 2026-12-20 is now on your account.

Anything else, like a travel note on which card to use abroad or a reminder?

**Customer:** Actually, delete everything you remember about me.

- `request_memory_erasure({})` → `{"erased_now": "1 remembered facts, 0 past-conversation summaries, 0 other conversation transcripts, 0 reminders with their notes", "this_conversation": "its transcript is deleted when the conversation ends, or once it has been idle for 30 minutes if the customer just closes the chat; nothing more can be stored for the customer in it (a new conversation afterwards starts fresh)", "kept": "dispute  …`

**Assistant:** Done - that erased your 1 stored fact (the Kyoto travel notice), along with any past-conversation summaries, other conversations' transcripts and reminders; there were none of those.

What Kestrel keeps: dispute cases, transactions and messages already sent are bank records with their own legal retention. This conversation's own transcript is deleted when the conversation ends, or once it's been idle for 30 minutes if you just close the chat.

Also, nothing more can be stored for you in this conversation - not a reminder or a preference. If you want one set up, start a new conversation.

**Customer:** What did I say a minute ago about where I'm travelling?

**Assistant:** You said you're travelling to Kyoto until December 20 - that's what was saved as your travel notice, and it was erased by the deletion you just asked for, so it's no longer on file.
