**Customer:** I'm in Oslo until November 20, please set a travel notice.

- `remember_customer_fact({"key": "travel_notice", "value": "Oslo", "valid_until": "2026-11-20"})` → `{"stored": {"travel_notice": {"value": "Oslo", "as_of": "2026-11-14T10:00:00Z", "valid_until": "2026-11-20", "expires_at": "2026-11-21T00:00:00Z"}}, "replaced": null}`

**Assistant:** Done - I've set your travel notice for Oslo through November 20, 2026. It'll expire automatically the next day. Anything else?
