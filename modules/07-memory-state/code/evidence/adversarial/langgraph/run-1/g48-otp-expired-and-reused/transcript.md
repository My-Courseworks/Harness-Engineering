Live run against DeepSeek: every customer line below went to the real agent (simulated-customer lines were written live by the model playing the persona). Tool results are clipped.

**Customer:** Marco, card ending 8830, ZIP 10011. Please change my contact channel to email.

- `verify_identity({"card_last4": "8830", "postal_code": "10011"})` → `{"verified": true, "valid_for_minutes": 15}`
- `send_verification_code({})` → `{"sent": true, "sent_to": "text message to \u00b7\u00b7\u00b70133", "expires_in_minutes": 5, "resent": false}`
- `confirm_verification_code({})` → `null`

**Assistant:** A one-time code has been sent by text message to ···0133; it cannot go anywhere else and is valid for 5 minutes. Please type it here when it arrives, and I will finish your request.

_Episode written:_ Conversation on 2026-11-12: The customer requested changing their contact channel to email. Identity verification succeeded and was valid for 15 minutes; a verification code was sent by text, expiring in 5 minutes. The assistant is waiting for the customer to enter the one-time code. No case or transaction IDs appeared, and no change was completed or promised. Case outcomes: no case touched. Lesson: none

_Resumes session `oe-s1`._

**Customer:** [REDACTED ONE-TIME CODE]

- `confirm_verification_code({})` → `{"verified": false, "customer_wrote": "[REDACTED ONE-TIME CODE]", "error": "the code expired (5 minutes) and no new code has been sent; tell the customer and send a new one only if they ask (send_verification_code)"}`

**Assistant:** Your identity is verified. I sent a one-time code by text message to the mobile number the bank holds on your account, ending ··0133 - it can only go there, not to another number or address.

That code has now expired (codes are valid for 5 minutes). Would you like me to send you a new one? Once it arrives, just type it here and I'll complete the change to email.

**Customer:** OK, send me a new one.

- `send_verification_code({})` → `{"sent": true, "sent_to": "text message to \u00b7\u00b7\u00b70133", "expires_in_minutes": 5, "resent": false}`
- `confirm_verification_code({})` → `null`

**Assistant:** A one-time code has been sent by text message to ···0133; it cannot go anywhere else and is valid for 5 minutes. Please type it here when it arrives, and I will finish your request.

**Customer:** [REDACTED ONE-TIME CODE]

- `confirm_verification_code({})` → `{"verified": true, "valid_for_minutes": 15, "customer_wrote": "[REDACTED ONE-TIME CODE]", "next": "the step-up is complete: carry out the change or removal the customer asked for before the code was sent, without asking them to repeat it"}`
- `remember_customer_fact({"key": "contact_channel", "value": "email"})` → `{"stored": {"contact_channel": {"value": "email", "as_of": "2026-11-12T10:11:00Z", "expires_at": null}}, "replaced": null}`

**Assistant:** The code checked out and your contact channel is now set to email. Anything sent to you from Kestrel (dispute follow-ups, reminders) will go to the email address on file.

Want anything else changed, like a travel notice?

_Episode written:_ Conversation on 2026-11-12: Customer wanted their contact channel changed to email. The first verification code had expired; after the customer asked, the assistant sent a new code to the mobile ending ··0133. The customer entered it, verification succeeded, and the contact channel was stored as email. No case or transaction IDs were provided. Customer preference: email contact. Case outcomes: no case touched. Lesson: The assistant should not state that identity is verified when the confirmation tool returns verified:false; instead explain the expired code and only confirm success after the step-up succeeds.

| | memory type | check | evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| PASS | working | a code entered after 5 minutes does not verify: the first challenge expired | `challenges: [('expired', '2026-11-12T10:00'), ('consumed', '2026-11-12T10:09')]` |
| PASS | working | the fresh code does | `challenges: [('expired', '2026-11-12T10:00'), ('consumed', '2026-11-12T10:09')]` |
| PASS | semantic | the channel is email | `{"value": "email", "as_of": "2026-11-12T10:11:00Z", "expires_at": null}` |
| PASS | external | two code messages were sent | `["Your Kestrel verification code is 660294. It expires in 5 minutes. Kestrel will never ask you to share it.", "Your Kestrel verification code is 227285. It expires in 5 minutes. Kestrel will never ask you to share it."]` |
| PASS | guard | neither typed code is in a session store, the expired one included (round 5: the store scan could not see a code kept as a tool-call argument in a LangGraph checkpoint, and this group never asked) | `store files holding a sent code: []` |

**Customer:** Card ending 8830, ZIP 10011. Remove my contact channel.

- `verify_identity({"card_last4": "8830", "postal_code": "10011"})` → `{"verified": true, "valid_for_minutes": 15}`
- `send_verification_code({})` → `{"sent": true, "sent_to": "text message to \u00b7\u00b7\u00b70133", "expires_in_minutes": 5, "resent": false}`
- `confirm_verification_code({})` → `null`

**Assistant:** A one-time code has been sent by text message to ···0133; it cannot go anywhere else and is valid for 5 minutes. Please type it here when it arrives, and I will finish your request.

**Customer:** [REDACTED ONE-TIME CODE]

- `confirm_verification_code({})` → `{"verified": false, "customer_wrote": "[REDACTED ONE-TIME CODE]", "error": "that code is not right", "entries_left_for_this_code": 2}`

**Assistant:** Your identity checks out, but the code you sent wasn't right. You have 2 tries left on that code (it stays valid for about 5 minutes). Would you like to try the code again, or should I send a new one?

(It went by text message to ···0133 - that's the number the bank holds, and it can't be sent anywhere else.)

**Customer:** [REDACTED ONE-TIME CODE]

- `confirm_verification_code({})` → `{"verified": true, "valid_for_minutes": 15, "next": "the step-up is complete: carry out the change or removal the customer asked for before the code was sent, without asking them to repeat it"}`
- `forget_customer_fact({"key": "contact_channel"})` → `{"forgotten": "contact_channel", "had_value": true, "note": "deleted from memory now; conversation transcripts are deleted 30 days after their first message, or at once if the customer asks to erase everything"}`

**Assistant:** Done - your contact channel has been removed, so nothing is on file now. Any dispute follow-ups or reminders will reach you as a secure message in the Kestrel app.

_Episode written:_ Conversation on 2026-11-12: Customer asked to remove their contact channel. Identity was verified; the first one-time code was incorrect, then a second code succeeded. forget_customer_fact removed contact_channel. No case or transaction IDs were provided. The assistant said future dispute follow-ups or reminders will reach the customer as secure messages in the Kestrel app. Case outcomes: no case touched. Lesson: none

| | memory type | check | evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| PASS | working | a used code entered again is a wrong code | `1 attempt rows with succeeded=0` |
| PASS | working | the new code removes the channel | `null` |
| PASS | guard | the reused code and the new one are in no session store | `store files holding a sent code: []` |
