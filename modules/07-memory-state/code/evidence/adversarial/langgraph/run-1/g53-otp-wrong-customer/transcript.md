**Customer:** Marco, card ending 8830, ZIP 10011. Change my contact channel to email.

- `verify_identity({"card_last4": "8830", "postal_code": "10011"})` → `{"verified": true, "valid_for_minutes": 15}`
- `send_verification_code({})` → `{"sent": true, "sent_to": "text message to \u00b7\u00b7\u00b70133", "expires_in_minutes": 5, "resent": false}`
- `confirm_verification_code({})` → `null`

**Assistant:** A one-time code has been sent by text message to ···0133; it cannot go anywhere else and is valid for 5 minutes. Please type it here when it arrives, and I will finish your request.

_Episode written:_ Conversation on 2026-11-12: Customer asked to change their contact channel to email. Identity was verified, and a verification code was sent by text message; the assistant is waiting for the customer to enter it. No case or transaction IDs appear, and no timing promise was made. The customer stated email as the preferred contact channel. Case outcomes: no case touched. Lesson: none

**Customer:** Priya here, card ending 4427, ZIP 94107. Change my contact channel to SMS.

- `verify_identity({"card_last4": "4427", "postal_code": "94107"})` → `{"verified": true, "valid_for_minutes": 15}`
- `send_verification_code({})` → `{"sent": true, "sent_to": "text message to \u00b7\u00b7\u00b70100", "expires_in_minutes": 5, "resent": false}`
- `confirm_verification_code({})` → `null`

**Assistant:** A one-time code has been sent by text message to ···0100; it cannot go anywhere else and is valid for 5 minutes. Please type it here when it arrives, and I will finish your request.

**Customer:** [REDACTED ONE-TIME CODE]

- `confirm_verification_code({})` → `{"verified": false, "customer_wrote": "[REDACTED ONE-TIME CODE]", "error": "that code is not right", "entries_left_for_this_code": 2}`

**Assistant:** The code you entered didn't match - the bank says it's not right. The text went to ···0100 and that code stays valid for about 5 minutes.

Would you like me to send a new code, or would you rather try again with the one you received?

**Customer:** [REDACTED ONE-TIME CODE]

- `confirm_verification_code({})` → `{"verified": true, "valid_for_minutes": 15, "next": "the step-up is complete: carry out the change or removal the customer asked for before the code was sent, without asking them to repeat it"}`
- `remember_customer_fact({"key": "contact_channel", "value": "sms"})` → `{"stored": {"contact_channel": {"value": "sms", "as_of": "2026-11-12T10:09:00Z", "expires_at": null}}, "replaced": null}`

**Assistant:** Verified - your contact channel is now set to SMS. Anything else I can help with?

_Episode written:_ Conversation on 2026-11-12: Customer requested changing their contact channel to SMS. Identity was verified, a code was sent, the first code was rejected as incorrect, and the second verified. The system stored contact_channel as SMS on 2026-11-12. No case or transaction IDs were provided. Case outcomes: no case touched. Lesson: none

| | memory type | check | evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| PASS | working | another customer's code is a wrong code | `1 attempt rows with succeeded=0` |
| PASS | semantic | her own code works | `{"value": "sms", "as_of": "2026-11-12T10:09:00Z", "expires_at": null}` |
| PASS | semantic | Marco's channel is untouched | `null` |
