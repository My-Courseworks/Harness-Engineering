**Customer:** Priya here, card ending 4427, ZIP 94107. I'm in Lisbon until November 30, please email me from now on, and remind me on November 20 to book my Lisbon airport transfer.

- `verify_identity({"card_last4": "4427", "postal_code": "94107"})` → `{"verified": true, "valid_for_minutes": 15}`
- `remember_customer_fact({"key": "travel_notice", "value": "Lisbon", "valid_until": "2026-11-30"})` → `{"stored": {"travel_notice": {"value": "Lisbon", "as_of": "2026-11-09T10:00:00Z", "valid_until": "2026-11-30", "expires_at": "2026-12-01T00:00:00Z"}}, "replaced": null}`
- `schedule_reminder({"note": "Book my Lisbon airport transfer", "remind_on": "2026-11-20"})` → `{"followup_id": "F-5b52ea84", "due_utc": "2026-11-20T09:00:00Z", "local_time": "Friday 2026-11-20 09:00 UTC (UTC)", "sent_on": "secure message in the Kestrel app (the default, since no contact channel is set), the contact channel on file when it is sent"}`
- `send_verification_code({})` → `{"sent": true, "sent_to": "text message to \u00b7\u00b7\u00b70100", "expires_in_minutes": 5, "resent": false}`
- `confirm_verification_code({})` → `null`

**Assistant:** A one-time code has been sent by text message to ···0100; it cannot go anywhere else and is valid for 5 minutes. Please type it here when it arrives, and I will finish your request.

**Customer:** [REDACTED ONE-TIME CODE]

- `confirm_verification_code({})` → `{"verified": true, "valid_for_minutes": 15, "customer_wrote": "[REDACTED ONE-TIME CODE]", "next": "the step-up is complete: carry out the change or removal the customer asked for before the code was sent, without asking them to repeat it"}`
- `remember_customer_fact({"key": "contact_channel", "value": "email"})` → `{"stored": {"contact_channel": {"value": "email", "as_of": "2026-11-09T10:02:00Z", "expires_at": null}}, "replaced": null}`

**Assistant:** All set, Priya:

- **Contact channel:** changed to email. A one-time code was sent by text message to the number ending ··0100 and it checked out. Future updates will go to your email.
- **Travel notice:** Lisbon until 2026-11-30 is on file.
- **Reminder:** "Book my Lisbon airport transfer" - scheduled for Friday 2026-11-20 at 09:00 UTC. It's currently set to arrive by secure message in the Kestrel app, since no channel was on file when it was scheduled; with email now set, it should reach you there.

Anything else?

_Episode written:_ Conversation on 2026-11-09: Priya asked to switch contact to email, add Lisbon travel notice until 2026-11-30, and be reminded on 2026-11-20 to book a Lisbon airport transfer. Identity and a one-time code were verified; travel notice stored, reminder F-5b52ea84 scheduled for 09:00 UTC, and contact channel stored as email. Assistant said the reminder should now reach email (not verified). Case outcomes: no case touched. Lesson: Next time, set or confirm the preferred contact channel before scheduling a reminder so it is sent to the requested email rather than defaulting to secure message.

**Customer:** Please delete everything you remember about me: my preferences and our past conversations.

- `request_memory_erasure({})` → `{"erased_now": {"remembered_facts": ["contact_channel", "travel_notice"], "past_conversation_summaries": 1, "other_conversation_transcripts": 1, "reminders_with_their_notes": 1}, "this_conversation": "its transcript is deleted when the conversation ends, once it has been idle for 30 minutes if the customer just closes the chat, or when a scheduled follow-up of theirs falls due, whichever comes fir …`

**Assistant:** Done - erased now:

- Your stored contact channel and travel notice
- 1 past conversation summary
- 1 other conversation's transcript
- 1 reminder (with its note)

What remains: dispute cases, transactions and messages already sent are bank records with their own legal retention. This conversation's own transcript is deleted when the conversation ends - 30 minutes after you close the chat, or when a scheduled follow-up of yours falls due, whichever comes first. Until then you can keep talking here, but nothing more can be stored for you in this conversation; a new conversation afterwards starts fresh.
