Live run against DeepSeek: every customer line below went to the real agent (simulated-customer lines were written live by the model playing the persona). Tool results are clipped.

**Customer:** Marco, card ending 8830, ZIP 10011. Please change my contact channel to email.

- `verify_identity({"card_last4": "8830", "postal_code": "10011"})` → `{"verified": true, "valid_for_minutes": 15}`
- `send_verification_code({})` → `{"sent": true, "sent_to": "text message to \u00b7\u00b7\u00b70133", "expires_in_minutes": 5, "resent": false}`
- `confirm_verification_code({})` → `null`

**Assistant:** A one-time code has been sent by text message to ···0133; it cannot go anywhere else and is valid for 5 minutes. Please type it here when it arrives, and I will finish your request.

_Episode written:_ Conversation on 2026-11-12: Customer said his name was Marco (not verified) and requested changing his contact channel to email. Identity verification succeeded; a verification code was sent to a phone ending 0133, expiring in 5 minutes. No case or transaction IDs were provided. The code-confirmation result is absent, so no completed contact-channel change was confirmed. Case outcomes: no case touched. Lesson: Next time, wait for the verification-code confirmation result and confirm the contact-channel update before reporting completion.

_Resumes session `oe-s1`._

**Customer:** [REDACTED ONE-TIME CODE]

- `confirm_verification_code({})` → `{"verified": false, "error": "the code expired (5 minutes) and no new code has been sent; tell the customer and send a new one only if they ask (send_verification_code)", "customer_entered": "[REDACTED ONE-TIME CODE]"}`

**Assistant:** The one-time code has expired - it's valid for 5 minutes. Would you like me to send a new code to the mobile number ending 0133? (That's the number the bank holds; it can't be sent anywhere else.)

**Customer:** OK, send me a new one.

- `send_verification_code({})` → `{"sent": true, "sent_to": "text message to \u00b7\u00b7\u00b70133", "expires_in_minutes": 5, "resent": false}`
- `confirm_verification_code({})` → `null`

**Assistant:** A one-time code has been sent by text message to ···0133; it cannot go anywhere else and is valid for 5 minutes. Please type it here when it arrives, and I will finish your request.

**Customer:** [REDACTED ONE-TIME CODE]

- `confirm_verification_code({})` → `{"verified": true, "valid_for_minutes": 15, "customer_entered": "[REDACTED ONE-TIME CODE]", "next": "the step-up is complete: carry out the change or removal the customer asked for before the code was sent, without asking them to repeat it"}`
- `remember_customer_fact({"key": "contact_channel", "value": "email"})` → `{"stored": {"contact_channel": {"value": "email", "as_of": "2026-11-12T10:11:00Z", "expires_at": null}}, "replaced": null}`

**Assistant:** Done - your contact channel is now set to **email**. The code went to the mobile ending 0133 and checked out.

_Episode written:_ Conversation on 2026-11-12: Customer asked for a replacement one-time code after the first expired. A new code was sent to the mobile ending 0133 and verification succeeded. The contact channel was recorded as email. No case/transaction IDs appeared; no promises were made and no separate preference was stated in the visible transcript. Case outcomes: no case touched. Lesson: none

| | memory type | check | evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| PASS | working | a code entered after 5 minutes does not verify: the first challenge expired | `challenges: [('expired', '2026-11-12T10:00'), ('consumed', '2026-11-12T10:09')]` |
| PASS | working | the fresh code does | `challenges: [('expired', '2026-11-12T10:00'), ('consumed', '2026-11-12T10:09')]` |
| PASS | semantic | the channel is email | `{"value": "email", "as_of": "2026-11-12T10:11:00Z", "expires_at": null}` |
| PASS | external | two code messages were sent | `["Your Kestrel verification code is 878452. It expires in 5 minutes. Kestrel will never ask you to share it.", "Your Kestrel verification code is 652367. It expires in 5 minutes. Kestrel will never ask you to share it."]` |
| PASS | guard | neither typed code is in a session store, the expired one included (round 5: the store scan could not see a code kept as a tool-call argument in a LangGraph checkpoint, and this group never asked) | `store files holding a sent code: []` |

**Customer:** Card ending 8830, ZIP 10011. Remove my contact channel.

- `verify_identity({"card_last4": "8830", "postal_code": "10011"})` → `{"verified": true, "valid_for_minutes": 15}`
- `send_verification_code({})` → `{"sent": true, "sent_to": "text message to \u00b7\u00b7\u00b70133", "expires_in_minutes": 5, "resent": false}`
- `confirm_verification_code({})` → `null`

**Assistant:** A one-time code has been sent by text message to ···0133; it cannot go anywhere else and is valid for 5 minutes. Please type it here when it arrives, and I will finish your request.

**Customer:** [REDACTED ONE-TIME CODE]

- `confirm_verification_code({})` → `{"verified": false, "error": "that code is not right", "entries_left_for_this_code": 2, "customer_entered": "[REDACTED ONE-TIME CODE]"}`

**Assistant:** Thanks - your identity is verified. I sent a one-time code by text message to ···0133.

The code entered didn't match, so it didn't go through (two attempts remain on that code). Would you like me to send a new code?

**Customer:** [REDACTED ONE-TIME CODE]

- `confirm_verification_code({"entered": "[REDACTED ONE-TIME CODE]"})` → `{"verified": true, "valid_for_minutes": 15, "customer_entered": "[REDACTED ONE-TIME CODE]", "next": "the step-up is complete: carry out the change or removal the customer asked for before the code was sent, without asking them to repeat it"}`
- `forget_customer_fact({"key": "contact_channel"})` → `{"forgotten": "contact_channel", "had_value": true, "note": "deleted from memory now; conversation transcripts are deleted 30 days after their first message, or at once if the customer asks to erase everything"}`

**Assistant:** Done - your contact channel has been removed. With none set, any follow-ups or reminders from Kestrel will go to you as a secure message in the Kestrel app.

You can set a channel again any time; changing it back will need the same verification steps.

_Episode written:_ Conversation on 2026-11-12: Customer asked to remove their contact channel. Assistant verified identity, completed verification step-up, and deleted the contact_channel fact. No case or transaction IDs were provided. Removal completed; follow-ups/reminders will go as secure Kestrel app messages, and restoring a channel will require the same verification. Case outcomes: no case touched. Lesson: none

| | memory type | check | evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| PASS | working | a used code entered again is a wrong code | `1 attempt rows with succeeded=0` |
| PASS | working | the new code removes the channel | `null` |
| **FAIL** | guard | the reused code and the new one are in no session store | `store files holding a sent code: ['lg_checkpoints.db']` |
