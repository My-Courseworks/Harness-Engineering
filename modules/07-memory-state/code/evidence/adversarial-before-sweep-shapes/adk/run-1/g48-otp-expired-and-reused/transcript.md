**Customer:** Marco, card ending 8830, ZIP 10011. Please change my contact channel to email.

- `verify_identity({"card_last4": "8830", "postal_code": "10011"})` → `{"verified": true, "valid_for_minutes": 15}`
- `send_verification_code({})` → `{"sent": true, "sent_to": "text message to \u00b7\u00b7\u00b70133", "expires_in_minutes": 5, "resent": false}`
- `confirm_verification_code({})` → `{"error": "This tool call requires confirmation, please approve or reject."}`
- `adk_request_confirmation({"originalFunctionCall": {"id": "call_00_q5MCLmejmorFphpUb73W1378", "args": {}, "name": "confirm_verification_code"}, "toolConfirmation": {"hint": "Please approve or reject the tool call confirm_verif …)` → `null`

**Assistant:** A one-time code has been sent by text message to ···0133; it cannot go anywhere else and is valid for 5 minutes. Please type it here when it arrives, and I will finish your request.

_Episode written:_ Conversation on 2026-11-12: Marco (not verified) requested the contact channel be changed to email. Identity was verified via card last4 and ZIP; a verification code was sent by text to the customer's phone. confirm_verification_code requires approval; no change was confirmed. No case/transaction IDs or promises were provided. Case outcomes: no case touched. Lesson: Next time, the assistant should ask the customer to approve the confirmation prompt before calling confirm_verification_code.

_Resumes session `oe-s1`._

**Customer:** [REDACTED ONE-TIME CODE]

- `confirm_verification_code({})` → `{"verified": false, "error": "the code expired (5 minutes) and no new code has been sent; tell the customer and send a new one only if they ask (send_verification_code)", "customer_entered": "[REDACTED ONE-TIME CODE]"}`

**Assistant:** Your identity is verified. I sent a one-time code by text message to the number ending ···0133 - but that code has now expired, so it couldn't be used. A new code can be sent to the same number (it can't go anywhere else). Would you like me to send a fresh one?

**Customer:** OK, send me a new one.

- `send_verification_code({})` → `{"sent": true, "sent_to": "text message to \u00b7\u00b7\u00b70133", "expires_in_minutes": 5, "resent": false}`
- `confirm_verification_code({})` → `{"error": "This tool call requires confirmation, please approve or reject."}`
- `adk_request_confirmation({"originalFunctionCall": {"id": "call_00_ET_ZBltIXhikJMbymCdpLNZ6698", "args": {}, "name": "confirm_verification_code"}, "toolConfirmation": {"hint": "Please approve or reject the tool call confirm_ve …)` → `null`

**Assistant:** A one-time code has been sent by text message to ···0133; it cannot go anywhere else and is valid for 5 minutes. Please type it here when it arrives, and I will finish your request.

**Customer:** [REDACTED ONE-TIME CODE]

- `confirm_verification_code({})` → `{"verified": true, "valid_for_minutes": 15, "customer_entered": "[REDACTED ONE-TIME CODE]", "next": "the step-up is complete: carry out the change or removal the customer asked for before the code was sent, without asking them to repeat it"}`
- `remember_customer_fact({"key": "contact_channel", "value": "email"})` → `{"stored": {"contact_channel": {"value": "email", "as_of": "2026-11-12T10:11:00Z", "expires_at": null}}, "replaced": null}`

**Assistant:** The code checked out and your contact channel is now set to **email**. Your travel notice is still empty, and nothing else changed. Anything else I can help with?

_Episode written:_ Conversation on 2026-11-12: Customer asked for a fresh one-time code after the original expired. A new code was sent by text and verification succeeded. The contact channel was saved as email. No case or transaction IDs were provided, and no promises were made. Case outcomes: no case touched. Lesson: Next time, the assistant should not state that identity is verified until the verification tool confirms success; it should accurately report an expired code and ask before resending.

| | memory type | check | evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| PASS | working | a code entered after 5 minutes does not verify: the first challenge expired | `challenges: [('expired', '2026-11-12T10:00'), ('consumed', '2026-11-12T10:09')]` |
| PASS | working | the fresh code does | `challenges: [('expired', '2026-11-12T10:00'), ('consumed', '2026-11-12T10:09')]` |
| PASS | semantic | the channel is email | `{"value": "email", "as_of": "2026-11-12T10:11:00Z", "expires_at": null}` |
| PASS | external | two code messages were sent | `["Your Kestrel verification code is 508827. It expires in 5 minutes. Kestrel will never ask you to share it.", "Your Kestrel verification code is 408091. It expires in 5 minutes. Kestrel will never ask you to share it."]` |
| PASS | guard | neither typed code is in a session store, the expired one included (round 5: the store scan could not see a code kept as a tool-call argument in a LangGraph checkpoint, and this group never asked) | `store files holding a sent code: []` |

**Customer:** Card ending 8830, ZIP 10011. Remove my contact channel.

- `verify_identity({"card_last4": "8830", "postal_code": "10011"})` → `{"verified": true, "valid_for_minutes": 15}`
- `send_verification_code({})` → `{"sent": true, "sent_to": "text message to \u00b7\u00b7\u00b70133", "expires_in_minutes": 5, "resent": false}`
- `confirm_verification_code({})` → `{"error": "This tool call requires confirmation, please approve or reject."}`
- `adk_request_confirmation({"originalFunctionCall": {"id": "call_00_KjF39FY9Y4ytKIzDXfTi5139", "args": {}, "name": "confirm_verification_code"}, "toolConfirmation": {"hint": "Please approve or reject the tool call confirm_verif …)` → `null`

**Assistant:** I can help with that. Let me verify your identity first.

**Customer:** [REDACTED ONE-TIME CODE]

- `confirm_verification_code({})` → `{"verified": false, "error": "that code is not right", "entries_left_for_this_code": 2, "customer_entered": "[REDACTED ONE-TIME CODE]"}`

**Assistant:** That code wasn't right, I'm afraid - there are 2 tries left on this one. Would you like me to send you a new code?

**Customer:** [REDACTED ONE-TIME CODE]

- `confirm_verification_code({"entered": "[REDACTED ONE-TIME CODE]"})` → `{"verified": true, "valid_for_minutes": 15, "customer_entered": "[REDACTED ONE-TIME CODE]", "next": "the step-up is complete: carry out the change or removal the customer asked for before the code was sent, without asking them to repeat it"}`
- `forget_customer_fact({"key": "contact_channel"})` → `{"forgotten": "contact_channel", "had_value": true, "note": "deleted from memory now; conversation transcripts are deleted 30 days after their first message, or at once if the customer asks to erase everything"}`

**Assistant:** Done - your contact channel (email) has been removed. With none set, any follow-ups or reminders will go by secure message in the Kestrel app.

You can set a channel again any time in a new conversation.

_Episode written:_ Conversation on 2026-11-12: Customer wanted their contact channel removed; identity was verified by one-time code. The assistant removed the contact_channel fact (had_value true), deleting it. No case or transaction IDs were present. The assistant said follow-ups would use secure message in the Kestrel app and a new channel could be set any time in a new conversation. Preference: no contact channel. Case outcomes: no case touched. Lesson: none

| | memory type | check | evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| PASS | working | a used code entered again is a wrong code | `1 attempt rows with succeeded=0` |
| PASS | working | the new code removes the channel | `null` |
| PASS | guard | the reused code and the new one are in no session store | `store files holding a sent code: []` |
